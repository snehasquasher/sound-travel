Erosion is a natural and beautiful process in and of itself, and one that inevitably occurs over the passing of time.

The soundscapes we captured aren&#8217;t incredibly diverse, since this was the height of the dry season and wildlife was struggling to survive away from water sources. As a result we could only hear insects and birds, and the ever-present soft wind that occasionally picked up with no apparent reason. Even so, to my ears this soundscape is magical and full of detail. The insect chorus changes endlessly, with patterns emerging and disappearing all the time. Every now and then a nightjar will start purring, and you can even hear a sleepy dove on occasion.

Birds are too busy feeding themselves and trying to stay warm so they don&#8217;t sing anymore. Even alarm calls are muted. The short days and freezing temperatures slow down nature and bring most activity to a halt. Wind is omnipresent and takes over the soundscape. If at first it all sounds a bit boring, listen for a while and you will notice there is infinite variation in the sound of wind. Factors like wind speed and direction, humidity levels or sunlight cause significant changes in the soundscape. </span></p>
<p><span class="yt-core-attributed-string yt-core-attributed-string--white-space-pre-wrap">Moving around the forest is an interesting experience because it can be quite challenging so you have to actively stop and listen.

<p>In summary, bees generate buzz through the rapid vibration of their wings, which is controlled by their thoracic muscles. The buzzing serves various purposes, including communication, defense, and pollination, and can be adjusted depending on the situation. Understanding how bees generate buzz is not only fascinating but also crucial for appreciating the essential role they play in our ecosystem.</p>
<h2>What Do Honey Bees Sound Like?</h2>
<p>Bees are known for their characteristic buzzing sound, which they generate through the rapid vibration of their wings. This buzzing serves several purposes, from communication within the hive to pollination of flowers. But how exactly do bees generate this buzzing sound?</p>
<p>The process begins with the contraction of the muscles in the bee&#8217;s thorax. These muscles control the movement of the wings and enable them to flap at an incredibly high frequency, up to 200 times per second. As the wings move, they create a disturbance in the air that produces sound waves, which we hear as the buzzing sound.</p>
<p>Interestingly, bees can adjust the frequency and intensity of their buzzing depending on the situation. For example, when the hive is threatened, they may generate a higher frequency and louder buzz to warn off predators. When they discover a new source of nectar, they may generate a more excited and energetic buzz to communicate this to other bees in the hive.</p>
<p>The ability to generate buzz is not only essential for communication and defense but also for the vital process of pollination. As bees buzz around flowers, their movement causes the release of pollen, which then fertilizes other flowers and allows them to reproduce.</p>
<p>Explore the fascinating world of bees with our recording from inside a beehive. Hear the buzzing of thousands of bees as they work together to create their home and produce honey.</p>
<h2>Where was the Recoding Made?</h2>
<p>The recording was made inside a beehive box located in a picturesque meadow surrounded by lush green forest. The meadow, which is in full bloom during the early summer season, is home to a diverse range of flora, including wildflowers and flowering shrubs that provide the bees with a rich source of nectar and pollen.</p>
<p>The beehive box itself is a marvel of engineering, with thousands of industrious bees working together to create a highly organized and efficient society. Inside the box, the bees can be seen tirelessly working to build their honeycomb homes, care for their young, and gather food for the hive.</p>
<p>The recording captures the unique sounds and rhythms of the beehive, from the gentle hum of the bees as they move about their tasks to the energetic buzz that signals excitement or danger. The busy and dynamic world of the beehive is a testament to the remarkable resilience and adaptability of these fascinating creatures.</p>
<p>By providing a window into the inner workings of the beehive, the recording offers a rare and insightful glimpse into the fascinating world of bees and the important role they play in our ecosystem.</p>',27196,263,NULL,NULL,26145);

Wexford, Ireland.</p>
<p>A recent study has revealed that Ireland has lost more wetland habitat than any other country in the entire world &#8211; we have lost over 90% of our wetlands in the last 300 years.</p>
<p>Tacumshin is a rare haven for wetland species in Ireland. However, all is not as it seems. Hunting at such locations is very common, and the very species which are set out to be protected are frequently terrified and flushed as a result of frequent gunshots, which of course are extremely loud and unsettling. This is the last kind of activity one would expect in an area set out to protect birds. Although the practice of hunting in such locations is, amazingly, *not illegal*, it is morally, ethically and unfathomably wrong in every facet.</p>
<p>These areas should be sanctuaries &#8211; safe havens for birds that are struggling to find habitat to feed and breed, many of which are in national or even global decline. Instead, with a general paucity of suitable habitat in the Irish landscape, many hunters come to these so-called Special Protection Areas, to essentially shoot goldfish in a barrel.</p>
<p>This needs to change. I think the first step in doing so is through sharing the truth with people so they can realize what is actually happening at these locations. If the general public were to know the bloody irony of shooting in a bird sanctuary, I am sure there would be increased pressure to bring true protection to these sites.</p>',26847,2401,NULL,NULL,22202);

<p>I recently travelled to the Amazon rainforest on the tri-border area of Brazil, Colombia and Peru. I was there in the so-called dry season, but that really doesn&#8217;t mean much.

<p>On this one evening, there was not one but two thunderstorms happening in the distance, with amazing lightning but with almost zero thunder sound reaching me. That in itself was a curiously disconnected experience. I was surrounded by the sounds of the rainforest and could barely hear the low rumble of distant rolling thunder. I felt suspended in a weird limbo where the thunderstorms were real but I could only perceive them with one of my senses. Soon enough this magic was broken as the sound started to reach me.</p>
<p>I had ample time to sit on the porch of my hut and observe the epic clouds in the distance. I took my time shooting photos and videos, and even a timelapse of a massive Cumulonimbus incus cloud taking over the local sky.

Motorised road traffic, scooters, drones, aircraft &#8211; these are elements that probably did not pollute the soundscapes in Mayan times. </p>
<p>On my expedition to Mexico I visited a few remote Mayan sites where most tourists didn&#8217;t venture. These sites are far away from busy roads, and only reachable on foot after long drives through the jungle. Once there, I set up a few recording rigs and left them out for several days at a time. I had a very knowledgeable local guide who helped me immensely.</p>
<p>Is that it? Yes, more or less. The soundscape might not be exactly the same as 500 or 2000 years ago, but it won&#8217;t be drastically different either. Some species might have moved in or become locally extinct. There are differences related to day/night cycles, seasons, global warming and cooling cycles, local weather and a myriad other events that can affect what a place sounds like. Having said that, most of the wildlife you can hear in this recording will probably have been here in Mayan times. </p>
<p>The acoustics of their cities are quite important to consider as well. The big plazas and stepped masonry structures with hard edges have lots of reflective surfaces. The soundscapes of their cities would be a beautiful mix of wild jungle soundscape with man-made acoustics and reflections. Pay attention and see if you can hear these reflections in this recording.</p>',25668,4004,NULL,NULL,22793);

<p>The wildlife of these dry forests is nothing short of unbelievable. Cryptic geckos and wonderfully-coloured chameleons abound. Many of the birds you can find here are endemics, as are most of the animals and even plants. The most striking creatures found here have to be the lemurs though. These primates evolved over millions of years to fill niches that would normally be taken by completely different species. Mouse lemurs (smallest primates in the world), sportive lemurs, sifakas, dwarf, brown and many other lemur species call these forests home. </p>
<p>The soundscape is fairly weird too. It&#8217;s not too lush or intense by any means. During the day it can be eerily quiet. There are soft swells at dawn and dusk, with a few bird species calling here and there. Night time is quite understated but fascinating, as you can hear in this recording. </p>

<p>Of all the rainforests I&#8217;ve visited in Madagascar, Masoala seems to be home to the most complex and lush soundscapes. The best moment to experience this is clearly the dawn chorus, although dusk choruses can also be pretty lively. </p>

A living memory of its trail in time and space, the river is perceived, celebrated, and in certain contexts, prayed for the monumental status that it has.</p>
<p>Nashik, an ancient city, also known as the wine capital of India, is an important Hindu religious site and hosts the Kumbh Mela: one of the largest human conglomerations in the world for a religious event.</p>
<p>Nashik is also an important industrial center in India and has enjoyed the status of a major tourist attraction, ever since it was established to be, during British colonial rule in India. It is based on the banks of the river Godavari.<br />
An overview of Nashik reaffirms the role of a river ecosystem in the establishment and growth of human settlements.</p>
<p>There are enough traces left, with regards to the journey of the river, to admire the settlement-river relationship for voyeuristic pleasure, which can be achieved through ecological and religious tourism in and around the city.</p>

Six nationally threatened bird species can be found on Gluepot Reserve and a further 17 regionally threatened bird species. In all, 190 bird species have been recorded thus far. Gluepot Reserve has a diversity of vegetation communities which support important wildlife other than birds. Reptiles are particularly abundant with 50 species located so far. Four species of frog have been identified, appearing only during the brief wet season. As in other areas, invertebrates dominate both the terrestrial and aquatic faunas of the mallee in terms of numbers of individuals, numbers of species and biomass. For example, over 150 species of ant, a dominant mallee group, have been found in a 50m x 50m square over one year.</p>
<p>Gluepot’s climate is relatively dry. Average rainfall around 200 – 250 mm and is characterised usually by short wet winters (April – August) followed by long hot dry summers. The dominant land forms are a dune/swale system – low east west “red” sand dunes with heavier clay soils in the swales between the dunes. This system is a legacy of a drier Geological time when the dunes were mobile. Dunes on Gluepot are now all vegetated. There are also areas of heavier clay soils which can become boggy after significant rain. (significant on Gluepot is anything above 25mm rain.) Hence the name “Gluepot”. The entire Reserve is underlain by extensive limestone layers, a legacy of past Geological times when the area was under shallow seas. Soils are generally alkaline.</p>
<p>Vegetation on Gluepot varies according to soil types. However, the dominant vegetation on Gluepot consists of mallee woodlands. Mallee is a relatively small (up to 7 meters) multi-stemmed eucalyptus. The word “Mallee” is believed to be of Indigenous derivation probably from Western Victoria and has been taken from the Indigenous name for this type of eucalyptus. Mallee is characterised by its lack of a main trunk and large underground lignotuber or “mallee root”. The species is generally slow growing and the wood hard. It was used extensively by early settlers for firewood. There are six major species of mallee on Gluepot.</p>',24254,3599,NULL,NULL,22771);
